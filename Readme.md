This is a sample project to demonstrate creating an Obsidian block outside of the core RockRMS project.

## Using this project

Create a symlink in the root repository directory pointing to your Rock SDK -> Rock.Javascript.Obsidian folder. The directory structure should look like this:

*Root folder*<br>
- org.abwe.ObsidianBoilerplate
    - Project files
- symlink to Rock.Javascript.Obsidian<br>
- RockWeb/Plugins/org_abwe/ObsidianBoilerplate/Blocks (generated by guild)

## Building this project

1. Run `npm run build` inside the org.abwe.ObsidianBoilerplate directory after creating your symlink
2. Open the org.abwe.ObsidiainBoilerplate VS project, build it, and add it as a reference to RockWeb (or manually copy the generated dll to your RockWeb/bin folder).

## Re-using this project

To create different blocks, there are a few things that need to change:
1. Rename the org.abwe.ObsidianBoilerPlate folder, VS project, files, and namespaces to represent your new block/org name
2. Change the `EntityTypeGuid` and `BlockTypeGuid` attributes in the main C# block class to GUIDs unique to your block
3. Change the `DisplayName` and `Category` attributes on the main C# block class
4. Change the `blocksPath` variable in rollup.config.js to represent your new org/block name: ```const blocksPath = path.join(workspacePath, "..", "RockWeb", "Plugins", "org_abwe", "ObsidianBoilerplate", "Blocks");```
5. Change the `ObsidianFileUrl` variable in the main C# block class to the path/block name you chose for rollup.config.js

## Other things you should know

The .code-workspace file in the root directory is significant for intellisense and syntax highlighting.
